# Description

Runkeeper want me to pay $5 a month for some statistic features. I simply built my
own graphing "thing" with Bash and Gnuplot. Saved. real. money.  


# Usage

You shouldn't have much to do. Clone the Repo, add your activity data in `activity.dat` 
and run the script:

    $ git clone https://github.com/noqqe/runkeeper-statistics.git
    $ cd runkeeper-statistics
    # Start adding your lines in activity.dat
    $ vi activity.dat
    [...]

    $ ./runkeeper-statistics
    [...]
    # Visit file:///path/to/runkeeper-statistics/html/index.html with your browser

# Dependencies

`bash >=4.1`, `awk`, `sed`, `bc`, `grep`. 
You see... should work on the most linux boxes.
